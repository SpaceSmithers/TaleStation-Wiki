Directly north is arrivals, dorms and some common areas.

Security occupies the north west portion of the station, with the chapel right next to it. 

Going east, science occupies most of the eastern wing of Lima. 

South east is where the Bridge, and further out, AI sat/Tcomms is located. 

South west is atmospherics, with directly west being the bulk of engineering and the engine room itself. 

In the center of the station is the bulk of service on the left, with medical on the right.

## LimaStation History
LimaStation is originally from [RussStation](https://github.com/RussStation/RussStation), but was ported by SQNZTB on December 8th, 2020 [here](https://github.com/TaleStation/JollyStation-Commit-Archive/commit/331c2f04cb426ae60922037c0ec249819792ae1d). It was merged into code on January 28th, 2021. 

Since the initial port, LimaStation has gone under many drastic changes since it was brought to the (formerly) JollyStation. LimaStation was original one Z level, however, a [rework](https://github.com/TaleStation/TaleStation/commit/cd2ac245b7d025283e883cb3bcc7c6370d2652a6) on August 11th, 2021 by SQNZTB revived Lima to be what we know it as today, making it Multi-Z.
