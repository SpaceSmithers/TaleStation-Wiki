Quotes: _I didn't feed the Research Director to the slimes, no sir no sir._

## Slime Ranch 13
The main and primary role of Xenobiologists is Xenobiology, the wonderful Slime Ranch simulation. 

More information on slimes and their mechanics can be found on /tg/ with the above linked guide.

Secondary roles include Cytology and Xenobotany. Cytology's guide is linked above, whilist Xenobotany currently lacks a significant amount of job content.

## Stealing the Botanists Role
Xenobiologists are capable of growing plants via Xenobotany. 

The following table highlights plant modifications made in code (these are from /tg/station):

| Plant | Mutations | Notes | 
|----|----|----|
| Cabbage | Removed | 
| Grass | Only fairy grass |
| Lemon | Removed |
| Plump Mushrooms | Removed |
| Orange | Only lime |
| Tomato | Only bluespace and blood |
| 3D Oranges | X | Xenobotany only |
| Carpet | X | Xenobotany only |
| Cherry Bombs | X | Xenobotany only | 
| Combustible Lemons | X | Xenobotany only | 
| Gatfruit | X | Xenobotany only | 
| Killer Tomatos | X | Xenobotany only |
| Replica Pods | X | Xenobotany only |
| Strange Seeds | | Xenobotany only |
| Walking Mushrooms | X | Xenobotany only |

The following table highlights new plants in code:
| Plant Name | Mutation(s) | Notes |

Xenobotany specific plants cannot be grown in regular hydroponic trays, cannot be processed by regular seed extractors OR be stored in them. Xenobotany seeds must be planted and stored in their specific Xenobotany hydroponic trays and seed extractors.

## History

Xenobiologist was first added to the game [here](https://github.com/TaleStation/JollyStation-Commit-Archive/commit/2275a07c43ce5ae9f411ef366c03e1ca836a2e71) on January 30th, 2021, alongside Toxicologist (Ordnance Technician).

Xenobiologist had a small content expansion/framework set for it called Xenobotany ([PR](https://github.com/TaleStation/TaleStation/pull/1205)) which was merged on July 4th, 2022.
