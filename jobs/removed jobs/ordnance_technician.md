## Researching Explosives

Ordnance Technician was a job originally added along side Xenobiologist as a way to try and make Ordnance, along with Xenobiology, a more "in-depth job". However, ideas never came to fruition for both jobs, and ultimately, Ordnance Technician eventually got axed and was integrated back into science.
