## Bridge Officer, Fetch Me Some Coffee
Bridge Officers are pseudo-command adjacent jobs, and are responsible for dealing with the real Heads of Staff affairs.

Bridge Officers occupy as their name implies, the bridge. More times than not they share their office with the Asset Protection, although, despite having an office, they have less power than the Asset Protection.

## The Fax Machine
The Command Fax Machine is the Bridge Officers bread and butter. Not only can you annoy unsuspecting ~~admins~~ Central Command Officials, but you can also file paperwork in a similar fashion to cargos manifests.

### Paperwork
Paperwork can range from patents to criminal trials. Involved parties can range from other factions, tribes and so on.

To process paperwork, you must
1. Print the paperwork
2. Using a pen, "write" on the paper
3. A prompt will open and ask you something about the paper
4. If there's no discrepancies, approve the paper and send it back
5. If there are discrepancies, deny the paper and send it back

Should you succeed, you'll earn yourself a nice stipend.

Fail, and you don't get anything.

Paperwork generates over time and the fax machine can hold a total of **eight** pages. You can disable incoming paperwork bounties if you desire.

## History
Originally, the Bridge Officer _was_ the Asset Protection (similar roles to the name is Blueshield).

Bridge Officers were originally the "secret agent" getup, whilst still providing from the Heads of Staff in their formalities. 

Since the introduction of the Asset Protection, the whole "secret agent" deal was retired, and Bridge Officers became the butt-end joke of everyone. Nothing more than a paperwork monkey.
