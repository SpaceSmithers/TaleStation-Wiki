## The Site Director is Dead? Oh, Damn..
The Asset Protection is responsible for ensuring the Heads of Staff stay alive above everything else. Despite having a gun, and access TO guns, they are **not** a security job, and do not care if an Assistant is tiding into cargo, UNLESS said Assistant is attacking the Quartermaster. 

### Caring for the Site Director
The Site Director is an important figure, as they should be. They can go anywhere, anytime, and leave you behind.

They're also responsible for securing the nuclear auth. disk. In any even they give it to you, just remember, you're now just as valuable. Except you don't have an all access card, boo.

If anyone attempts to approach the Site Director in any suspicious ways, you may intervene and wedge yourself between the Site Director and the suspect. Remember, you are not security, but you may apprehend someone if needed. Call security if things start to get out of control and direct the Site Director to get to cover or get out of the area.

### Caring for the Head of Security
In any high stress situation, you may act as security UNDER the Head of Security. Your top priority is making sure the Heads of Staff are safe and secure.

The Head of Security may give you stronger guns, if needed, and more adequate equipment. Situations like these are rare, and the Head of Security has no right to give you access to the armory OR give you any sort of guns or armor without a stressful situation being present (i.e nukies).

### Caring for the Asset Clerk
The Asset Clerk is just as important as the Site Director: ~~they stamp your checks~~ Have access to the entire station, somewhat. Since the Asset Clerk has.. access (no pun intended) to more ID cards, any patron can in theory give themselves unlimited access. This unlimited access can further complicate things for you, the Asset Protection, as other Heads of Staff may become harmed!

If the Asset Clerk designates you to protect Ian and be their bodyguard, do not argue with the Asset Clerk. Its not your job to do so, and you WILL guard Ian with your life. Ian is just as important as the Asset Clerk, be honored that you have this duty.

### Caring for the Site Foreman
There won't be many cases where the Site Foreman needs assistance. They may be too preoccupied with their Engineers and Atmos Techs (or in Medical with sever radiation burns). 

In the event you _may_ need to help the Site Foreman, ensure you have proper gear and radiation proofing. The Supermatter, and many other engines, may emit harmful radiation. This doesn't bother anyone in Engineering, but it sure as hell will mutate you. You don't need to repair or fix anything by the way, just look pretty and try to not walk into the Supermatter. Nanotrasne isn't responsible for cleaning up your remains and neither is the Site Foreman.

### Caring for the Research Director
The Research Director is mildly capable of handling themselves, but this isn't your concern.

The Research Director may have created some wacky contraptions that may make it more difficult for you to track them and/or protect them. In the even they teleport into the burn tank in Ordnance, please rush in and pull their presumably husked corpse out. Don't worry, you can treat yourself at Medical, don't forget the Research Director.

In the event they're on the bombing test site and are now viscera and blood hurling back to the station, please contact Central Command for a copy of the Research Director.

### Caring for the Medical Director
Medical is occasionally known as a "giant gaping hole in the station" along with many corpses, the Medical Director included.

Medical is a hot target for antagonistic tendencies, many of which lead to brawls and an occasional crater. In the event of a bar style braw, you must escort the Medical Director out of Medical as quickly as possible. Do not engage in the brawl. Do not shoot the brawl. Do not worry about the timer ticking down that sounds like a bomb. Just get **out**.

### Caring for the Quartermaster
The Quartermaster is a lowly target for any antagonistic tendencies, but their access to a plethora of "goodies" says otherwise to some.

In the event you're stationed to assist the Quartermaster, check crate contents in case "Central Command" "sent" "goods" "correctly". If you find a bomb, please escort the Quartermaster out of cargo promptly.

### Caring for the Bridge Officer
Do not protect the Bridge Officer.

The Bridge Officer is not a Head of Staff.

Please laugh at the Bridge Officer as you have a gun and they don't.

What a loser.

### Caring for Yourself
Remember to ensure your own personal safety at the end of the day. If you're dead, so are the Heads of Staff.

Your choices should be logical, but shouldn't result in your death. Move the Heads of Staff if you have to, use force, grab them, shove them, do whatever it takes for you AND the Heads of Staff to get to safety with minimal harm to both of you.

## History
On other servers, this role is known as the Blueshield. The Asset Protection does take inspiration from the Blueshield, but is _not_ the same.
