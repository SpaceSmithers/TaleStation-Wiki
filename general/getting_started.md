# Flavor Text and Records

Flavor text is an extension of a players character. It can be useful information, descriptive, anything within reason that doesn't break server rules.

Flavor text is **required** to join/observe the round. You require a **minimum of 125 characters** to be allowed in.

There are also three kinds of extended flavor text for records: Medical, Security and General.

It's completely OK to hide deep lore/special information in your characters records. Be the captain of your own destiny.

Specific rules and policy about Flavor Text can be found [here]().

## Regular Flavor Text

This part of flavor text is used to describe your character! Height, age, occupation(s), what they were doing on November 2nd 25XX. Flavor text is aimed to be relatively serious, but its okay to have it be light hearted and goofy.

However, keep in mind creating "junk" flavor text is a banable offense. So, what qualifies as "junk" flavor text?
- Flavor text that is filled with nothing but single character(s) with the sole purpose of getting around the character requirement
- Flavor text that is too memey in nature
- Flavor text that makes no sense and is nonsensical
- Flavor text that breaks the rules

## General Records

<img align ="right" img src="https://github.com/TaleStation/TaleStation/assets/70232195/f8d1b4be-c590-47a6-a136-408ed417266e">

General records are viewable on all data consoles (med records, sec records). The information here is what it implies to be; general! Information of your characters past, things they've done, stuff you'd expect to be on a general record. 

It's in your hands to determine what you think would best fit here.

## Medical Records

<img align ="right" img src="https://github.com/TaleStation/TaleStation/assets/70232195/92a5600f-006f-4e7e-957c-27c277a525fc">

Medical records are as the name suggest: Medical records! You can keep a laundry list of medical aliments that have plagued your character

Fracture a wrist, caught the plague there, recloned on this date, so on and so fourth. You can even mention their quirks here, and how/why they came to be (in the instance of paraplegic or blindness). 

## Security Records

<img align ="right" img src="https://github.com/TaleStation/TaleStation/assets/70232195/afffc468-ce49-4e54-922a-4b0c50f805d5">

Like medical records, security records are as the name suggest.

Security records can go more in depth on what crimes your character has committed, from grand theft to petty littering. Keep in mind, however, keep in mind your records shouldn't be too "grand". If your character is known to kill captains and blow up stations, in a logical sense, NT wouldn't dare hire them and certainly put them on a "do not hire" list of sorts (or kill them on sight).

Security records can be tame, but they can't be too grand. Of all records present, sec records need to be the most thought out and written carefully.

## OOC Notes

<img align ="right" img src="https://github.com/TaleStation/TaleStation/assets/70232195/29357bcf-7ebc-4c90-bd8e-e3be8c16a7a7">

OOC Notes are a way to explain whats going on with your character. If you're new to the server, don't be shy! You can let people know here, and its okay! You can also use this area to deem if antagonists can attack you without any proper consent in LOOC beforehand. 

OOC notes are your key to maintaining comfortable play. However, like with general flavor text, putting junk in OOC notes can get you into trouble. Keep it informative!

## Flavor Text Examine Panel

This is where your normal flavor text is displayed. Kinda neat, isn't it?

Keep in mind, however, certain items can "obstruct" your flavor text, making it, well, obstructed. In this state, your flavor text is rendered unviewable. Keep that in mind if you're going for some sort of sabotage mission.

# Pixelshifting
Pixel shifting allows you to freely adjust the position of your character on a tile. If pixel-shifted far enough from the center of a tile, others can pass through your space without bumping into or swapping places with you; great for leaning against walls or objects.

To use pixel shift, hold down the keybind (defaults to `B`, but can be changed in Game Preferences -> Keybinds -> Movement) and use the movement keys.<br>

# Local Out of Character

Local Out of Character, or LOOC for short, is a version of OOC thats, well, local!
Players within normal viewing range can hear this version of OOC.

LOOC should still be treated as normal OOC, however, its okay to use it as a way to communicate with other party(ies) in the event you want to do something with them. The rules for OOC still apply to LOOC, that being, no IC in OOC. LOOC is still monitored by admins, so keep that in mind!

# TaleStation's Unique Jobs

TaleStation has a few unique jobs!
Here's a quick run down of them.

### [[Asset Protection]]

Your main job is to protect all the heads of staff, no matter the situation.
You are not security, so you do not involve yourself in security affairs. 
Exert authority over the Bridge Officer. Laugh at them for not having a gun.

### [[Bridge Officer]]

Your main job is to file paperwork and aid the heads of staff in any paperwork affairs.
You get a nifty fax machine. Use it to earn credits or annoy Central Command that the Site Director had died. Again.
Become the butt end joke that every head of staff makes. Cry because the Asset Protection is more important than you.

### [[Xenobiologist]]

Your main job is to hide in your lab all shift long, work with the slimes, and maybe do cytology.
You also get access to a unique version of botany, that allows you to grow more exotic plants that botany can't.
Confine yourself to your lab all shift. Emerge as the slime rancher addict you are, or a God, creator of whatever's now loose in the ventilation system.

# TaleStation's Unique Subsystem: Pain

*Please read the [[Pain]] page for more information. This is just a snippet!!*

Pain in the most simplest term, is a reaction following any sort of damage. It's a response system. You take damage, you feel pain.

Pain can vary in its degree of severity, from being very acute to being chronic. In the most extreme case, chronic pain can lead to an untimely death if not treated.

There are a handful of pain related chems that can ease its effects. However, time, body stability and rest are what'll cure it rapidly, as well as not bleeding all over the floors with your arms missing.
